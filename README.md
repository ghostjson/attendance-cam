# Attendance-Cam
This is an app used for taking attendance using a video camera.
The camera counts the number of students present in the class.
It uses sofware that can do the counting in a more efficient mannar thereby saving time.
OpenCV and python are the tools used to make this application.

This whole project is made from scratch using python,opencv etc. Any contribution to this project is very appreciable.
